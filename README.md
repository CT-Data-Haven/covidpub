# covidpub

Code for DataHaven's site on COVID-19 data, embedded at https://ctdatahaven.org/reports/covid-19-connecticut-data-analysis.

This is built as a simple RMarkdown site, with the billboarder and leaflet packages for visuals.

New data goes in the [./input_data](./input_data) folder and is updated as close to ~~daily~~ weekly as possible. Build is done with github actions and pkgdown.
