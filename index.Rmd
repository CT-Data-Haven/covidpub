This webpage provides graphics that are intended to communicate what we know about COVID-19 (also known as SARS-CoV-2) in Connecticut. These charts are not intended to predict any scenarios about the disease or the people affected by it. They merely reflect data that [DataHaven](https://ctdatahaven.org) has already collected at the town, county, and state levels. To the extent possible, this webpage is updated daily.

- While previous testing protocols restricted tests to contact tracing and specimen sampling of individuals exhibiting severe symptoms, these have since changed. For current information on testing, see [state guidance](https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/Covid-19-Knowledge-Base/COVID-19-Testing). Note that because testing coverage is still limited, *counts of detected cases almost certainly underestimate the true number of people infected with COVID-19.*

- **Detected cases** refer to individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 as confirmed by the State of Connecticut. *Due to current testing protocols, this number likely underestimates—possibly to a very large degree—the number of people who may currently have or have recovered from the disease.*

- **Hospitalizations** refer to patients who have been admitted to a hospital for complications arising from COVID-19. These are reported at the county level only and represent the county where the hospital is located, not the patient’s home county. On March 29, 2020, the State reported a change to the way hospitalizations were recorded and acknowledged that hospitalization counts prior to that date were underestimated. Hospitalization counts are only available starting on March 21.

- **Deaths** refer to individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 around the time of their death. This doesn\'t necessarily mean COVID-19 symptoms or complications specifically caused that person\'s death. *Because of testing protocols, this number is likely undercounted.*

- Some values are given as rates and are marked as such, where the number of cases is divided by population in order to meaningfully compare the relative magnitude of cases across areas.

```{r county_setup}

county_to_plot <- county %>%

# only showing places with at least X number of cases

```


### Detected cases by location as of `r date_range_fmt[2]`, of locations with at least `r reg_thresh` cases {.viz-title}

Rates are given here per 10,000 people by location—that is, a rate of 20 per 10,000 people in a town would mean that for every 10,000 residents of that town, an average of 20 people have tested positive for COVID-19.

Data show higher rates of detected cases and deaths among Black and Latino residents than other groups. The statewide total rates shown include patients without race/ethnicity given. Rates are again given per 10,000 people by race/ethnicity and adjusted for age. Statewide age-adjusted data became available in late May, and are preferable in comparing racial groups because they account for differing age distributions in populations.

Note that counts of COVID-19-related hospitalizations are only available from March 21 onward. Counts of tests are based on the date of specimen collection.

As access to testing expands with fewer restrictions blocking asymptomatic people from being tested, the test positivity rate (the percentage of tests administered that come back positive) has become another useful metric for measuring the response to the pandemic. Increasing the number of tests administered across the population means health officials have a better chance of detecting cases with few or no symptoms. Widespread, robust testing means the positivity rate should become very low; WHO guidance recommends maintaining a positivity rate below 5 percent as a target. 

Because test results may take several days to come back, the value shown here is a rolling average over 7 days.

Summarizing the past seven days of trends helps to smooth out daily jumps or drops in the number of reported cases. Looking at the seven days before that helps contextualize the most recent seven-day period. In rare instances, counties revise their case counts retroactively; if that happens over the 14 days shown here, that county is not displayed.

### Change in number of detected new cases over 7-day periods {.viz-title}

On [July 24th](https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2020/07-2020/Governor-Lamont-Coronavirus-Update-July-24) and [July 29th](https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2020/07-2020/Governor-Lamont-Coronavirus-Update-July-29), 440 and 384 cases respectively were newly reported by out-of-state regional laboratories to the Connecticut Department of Public Health. As a result, new case rates around these dates are considerably inflated and should be treated with caution. 

Spikes in reported cases during this period.

Governor Lamont's roadmap for the next phases of reopening ([pdf](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Office-of-the-Governor/News/20200526-Governors-Reopen-Report.pdf?la=en)) includes a goal of 100,000 tests per week in order to begin phase 2 on or around June 20. While the state has increased its testing capacity, the actual number of tests conducted per week still falls well below this goal. Most recently, in the week starting `r wk_test_dates[2]`, testing sites conducted a total of `r recent_test_num` tests.

One way to measure the impact of social distancing measures is through the distances people travel each day. Anonymized cell phone data shows the average number of miles traveled by people within each county starting March 2. As statewide executive orders restricting public and private gatherings and limiting nonessential travel, these average distances traveled dropped steeply.

Note that executive orders that took effect in the evening, such as the non-essential business closure, are dated here with the following day, as that is when they are likely to have had an impact on people's travel. To smooth out the day-to-day fluctuations in travel, including patterns of less travel on weekends and holidays, values here are shown as 7-day rolling averages.

## Community well-being

DataHaven recently completed its [2020 Community Wellbeing Survey](https://ctdatahaven.org/reports/datahaven-community-wellbeing-survey), with a statewide sample of more than 1,100 adult participants. The 2020 survey included a set of questions related to COVID-19 and its impacts on residents' well-being, resources, and quality of life. 

Survey participants were asked to rate the amount of trust they have in each of several public institutions to keep themselves and their families safe. Below are the shares of adults who reported having a great amount or a fair amount of trust in each institution. 

### Adults reporting great/fair amount of trust in public institutions to keep them safe, Connecticut, 2020 {.viz-title}

         indicator = as_factor(indicator) %>%

           fct_relabel(clean_titles))

  bb_colors_manual(set_names(c(pal[7]), levels(cws_trust$group)))
```

Survey participants were also asked how often they leave their home for work. Out of currently working adults, the shares saying they leave for work very often are below.

The US Census Bureau conducted a Household Pulse Survey between April and July to gauge several economic and health indicators throughout the country. The survey questions summarized here are for adults in Connecticut, based on the 12 weeks of data released.

Loss of income measures the share of adults for whom at least one member of their household lost work-related income (i.e. not public benefits) since March 13, 2020. Food insecurity refers to the share of adults that report having sometimes or often not had enough food at home over the previous 7 days. Housing insecurity refers to the share of adults that report having little to no confidence that their next month's housing payments can be made on time, out of adults whose households pay either rent or a mortgage.
