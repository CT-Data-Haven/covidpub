## Latest statewide data: `r date_range_fmt[2]` {.text-info}


This webpage provides graphics that are intended to communicate what we know about COVID-19 (also known as SARS-CoV-2) in Connecticut. These charts are not intended to predict any scenarios about the disease or the people affected by it. They merely reflect data that [DataHaven](https://ctdatahaven.org) has already collected at the town, county, and state levels. To the extent possible, this webpage is updated daily. 

For the latest information from the Connecticut Department of Public Health, visit http://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus

### Important data notes:

- Current testing protocols restrict tests to contact tracing and specimen sampling of individuals exhibiting severe symptoms. Test results also take several days to return after a specimen is collected and received. As such, counts of detected cases almost certainly underestimate the true number of people infected with COVID-19.

- **Detected cases** refer to individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 as confirmed by the State of Connecticut. *Due to current testing protocols, this number likely underestimates—possibly to a very large degree—the number of people who may currently have or have recovered from the disease.*

- **Hospitalizations** refer to patients who have been admitted to a hospital for complications arising from COVID-19. These are reported at the county level only and represent the county where the hospital is located, not the patient’s home county. On March 29, 2020, the State reported a change to the way hospitalizations were recorded and acknowledged that hospitalization counts prior to that date were underestimated. Hospitalization counts are only available starting on March 21.

- **Deaths** refer to individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 around the time of their death. This doesn\'t necessarily mean COVID-19 symptoms or complications specifically caused that person\'s death. *Because of testing protocols, this number is likely undercounted.*

- Some values are given as rates and are marked as such, where the number of cases is divided by population in order to meaningfully compare the relative magnitude of cases across areas.

Rates are given here per 10,000 people by location—that is, a rate of 20 per 10,000 people in a town would mean that for every 10,000 residents of that town, an average of 20 people have tested positive for COVID-19.

Early data suggest higher rates of detected cases and deaths among Black and Latino residents than average. Note that race/ethnicity is not known for all patients, particularly in case counts; as such, it is possible that more complete data would show slightly different rates. The average rates shown include patients without race/ethnicity given. Rates are again given per 10,000 people by race/ethnicity and adjusted for age. Statewide age-adjusted data became available in late May, and are preferable in comparing racial groups because they account for differing age distributions in populations.

One way to measure the impact of social distancing measures is through the distances people travel each day. Anonymized cell phone data shows the average number of miles traveled by people within each county starting March 2. As statewide executive orders restricting public and private gatherings and limiting nonessential travel, these average distances traveled dropped steeply.

Note that these executive orders took effect in the evening but are dated here with the following day, as that is when they are likely to have had an impact on people's travel.
